## **Basics**

When compiling an internship report, the student evaluates the results of the work and draws conclusions about his qualifications, knowledge and skills acquired at the university. In order for the work to be accepted, it must be not only competent and meaningful. Making a report in accordance with GOST will allow you to get "excellent" or at least "good".

Typically, the requirements for the design of the report are prescribed in the training manuals. If there are none left in the department or in the library, refer to the regulatory documents.

Does it take a lot of time to prepare a practice report in accordance with GOST? Take advantage of other people's experience - download the works that are relevant for the current year and see how they are designed. The main thing is that these examples themselves meet the latest requirements.

Practice Report Structure
The report can contain up to 35-40 pages. In some cases, it is allowed to increase the volume up to 45 pages. At the same time, two or three pages are allotted for the introduction. A work can have up to four sections.

According to GOSTs, the practice report should have the following structure:

— title page;</br>
— internship plan;</br>
— feedback from the head;</br>
— abstract;</br>
— section with abbreviations and symbols;</br>
— table of contents and introduction;</br>
— the main part of the practical work;</br>
— conclusion;</br>
— used literature list;</br>
- Applications and additional materials.

Applications are included in practice as needed.

The practice report always includes a plan and a review of the supervisor. These two sections follow one after the other in the work. After the review of the supervisor, an abstract is placed. It emphasizes the relevance of the work, its brief description is placed. The introduction should contain information about the practice: time, place, duration of the practice, as well as the types of work performed.

Job submission requirements
The design of the work in accordance with GOST implies not only a strict structure, but also the choice of certain fonts and their sizes, the competent design of the list of references and the correct placement of graphic elements in the text.

The text part of the practical work is performed in three main ways:

— on a computer according to GOST 2.004;</br>
— on a typewriter;</br>
-- by hand - according to GOST 2.304 (we are talking about the use of a drawing font).

If the report is typed on a computer and printed on a printer, then work should be done in Word or a similar editor. Print the report on A4 sheets. The text is typed in Times New Roman. Section headings have a font size of 16 points, subsection headings have a font size of 14 points. The main text is done in a regular font with a size of 14 points. The font in sections and subsections is bold. When designing, you need to select a single line spacing.

Additional information can be found in GOST 2.105-79 and GOST 7.32-2001.

Sections and subsections in the report
The practice report is divided into sections and subsections. If necessary, items and lists are included in the work. Sections almost always start on a new page. They are numbered with Arabic numerals in order of priority. The title of the section is centered and uses Times New Roman bold font (16 shingle).

Subsections are numbered with Arabic numerals. Uppercase letters are used for section titles, lowercase letters are used for subsections (except for the first one). The latter are left-aligned using the red line. For subsections, bold type (14 shingle) is used.

It is desirable that the titles of the sections be as concise as possible - words cannot be transferred. The same goes for subsections. The distance between the section title and the subsection title should be 8 mm.

Margins, padding and pages
As mentioned earlier, the practice report is drawn up on A4 sheets. This requirement applies to all sheets in the work, including the title page. Sheets should not have borders or similar elements. There are enough indents: on the left - 30 mm, on the right - 10 mm, on the top - 15 mm, on the bottom - 20 mm.

Pages are numbered, counting from the title page. The number on the title is not affixed.

Graphics, tables and other elements
The practice report may contain graphic elements, tables and formulas. According to GOST, images, tables and diagrams can be placed:

- immediately after the paragraph in which the element is mentioned;</br>
— on the next page;</br>
- in the application.

The first method is the most convenient: the person who starts reading the report will definitely not lose important data. He will immediately get acquainted with all the graphic elements.

Formulas are placed immediately after the mention. They are center aligned.

The formula can be created using the Equation Editor and then inserted into the text of the work. Usually 14 shingles are used for symbols in a formula.

Requirements for the form of presentation of the text of the report
Separate symbols in the practice report cannot be used:

- diameter icon (instead, they write the word "diameter");</br>
- the symbol "-" to indicate a negative temperature (the word "minus" is written instead);</br>
— indexes of standards without registration number;</br>
- mathematical symbols <, > and = without numbers.

A practice report may have its own system of names or abbreviations, but only if there is an appropriate section. It should be placed before the title.

Working on a practice report may seem tedious and dreary, but it is not at all as difficult as it seems. A text editor will make the task easier.
