One of my very first projects, I would like to dedicate to my recent idea, namely, a C# application for an easy way to learn foreign words. It will give the user a list of words that the user will have to translate, and the user himself can control the list of words of interest to him. If suddenly the user translated the word incorrectly, then the correct answer is shown to him, and the error is recorded in the list of errors, which the user can view at any time. The concept is quite simple, but I think it will be a good experience in developing simple C# applications.
